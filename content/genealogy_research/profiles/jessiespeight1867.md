## Birth
Jessie McCulloch Brown was born on the 3rd of November 1867 to parents Isabella Brown (n&eacute;e McFarlane) and Thomas Brown [^1]. Jessie was the second of four children, she had an older brother named Thomas Brown, and two younger brothers: John MacFarlane Brown and Robert Symington Brown.

### A note on McCulloch
It seems as though each of the Brown children carried a surname from each of their four grandparents - Brown obviously being their paternal grandfather's surname, MacFarlane being the maternal grandfather's surname, and it is possible that Symington and McCulloch were the maiden names of Jessie's grandmothers, though I can't confirm this right now - or indeed say which would be which. If I were to hazard a guess - which is obviously not recommended in genealogy research, but bear with me - I would guess it is Thomas' mother's maiden name. Interestingly - Thomas came to New Zealand on the ship 'Lady Egidia' in January 1861 which travelled from Greenock, Scotland, to Port Chalmers.[^21]  [^22] This is interesting because at approximately the same time, though no one has confirmed exactly when, a young lady named Williamina McCulloch also emigrated to New Zealand from that same town of Greenock, Scotland to Invercargill. Williamina (a.k.a. 'Minnie') went on to marry a man named Charles Dean, and was the only woman ever to be put to death in New Zealand.[^23] I'll keep looking into this to see if we really are related to her! Imagine!!

Sadly, Jessie's husband Charles Speight died on the 19th of February 1928 at the age of 62 [^18].

Charles died that afternoon, it is suspected that the cause of death was heart failure.
