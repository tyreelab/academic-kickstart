## Recently Added Profiles

* [Jane Donnelly (1860 - 1912)]({{< ref "/genealogy_research/profiles/janedonnelly1860.md" >}})

* [Mary Sillars (1848 - 1937)]({{< ref "/genealogy_research/profiles/marysillars1848.md" >}})


## Current Ancestor Profiles
I'm going to group these based on which grandparent's family they belong to, and within those groupings they will be alphabetical by last name (maiden name), then first name, then middle name, and if there are multiple family members with the same name they will then be ordered chronologically.

### Johnston Family Profiles

... Coming Soon ...

N.B. Some of these profiles aren't complete yet - I still have to add all of Katrena's acting roles and all the parties her and Hughie went to - but wanted to focus on adding more profiles to start with because there was a lot to get through! :sweat_smile:

Let me know if you have any resources you want to be added to these profiles :heart_eyes: the more - the merrier!
